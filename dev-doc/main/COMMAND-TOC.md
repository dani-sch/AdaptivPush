| `/document` | update the owning documentation surface for the change |
| `/session-handoff` | prepare a concise restart packet for the next session |

## Current execution lane

Use bounded Expo/TypeScript/Supabase AP slices from the [execution register](/dev-doc/plans/active/ADAPTIVPUSH-EXECUTION-REGISTER.md). First future packet is AP-01.1 after consolidation review. Planning documents do not authorize application or database implementation. Source/status and compatibility gates precede new exposed behavior.
