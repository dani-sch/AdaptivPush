## High-value workflow commands

| `/plan` | create or refresh an execution-ready plan |
| `/dev-log-generate` | add a structured development-log entry under `dev-doc/reports/` |
| `/verify` | run the smallest local verification gate that matches the work |
| `/document` | update the owning documentation surface for the change |
| `/session-handoff` | prepare a concise restart packet for the next session |

## Useful supporting commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/test` | run a targeted test or validation slice |
| `/review` | run a focused review on bounded changes |

| `/sprint` | sync living docs needed for workflow closeout |

## Current stage-3 execution owner

The current evidence-backed implementation work is best executed through bounded `typescript-agent` slices because the active work is overwhelmingly Expo, TypeScript, and Supabase client logic.
